 Aya, my name is Victor. For the project portfolio project, I did an e-commerce API. The API allows us to... I used the API allows buyers and sellers to connect and sell their products. I tried to make a project that would become an open source project. I also did this project by myself. I couldn't find any front-end partner. I just created the back-end API. I used Express.js. For the database, I used MongoDB. I used MongoDB because of the free hosting because of Atras. For the first project, I had used Flask. I wanted to give myself some challenge. I decided on Express. I prepared a collection. For the testing and because of the documentation. I think we should go through the testing. For the database, I can see right now I only have one. For the database, let's see how many... I've already appreciated some users here. We can group through the authentication routes. I have a register that will be used for users to sign up. For this, I... We had created one user. I think we should create a different one. I'm going to use a post request. I'm going to... Okay. I'm going to use a request sent. I think the registration has been successfully distributed. We have implemented an attribute here for user admin. Some routes will only be accessible to the admin. I implement this to allow only admin to change some of the things. We can log in. That's why we want to log in. Okay. Let's log in with the user that I've just created. I think that's why we need to use this. I also use a post request. I'll run the user name. Let's see. I don't test. I'm not testing. I'm not getting successful. You also have an access token. This access token will be used to authenticate every action that this user... You can change your... Maybe you can change your card. You can change your orders. But you have to use your access token. You cannot use another person's access token. It's just an authentication feature. You also have a logout. For the users, you have three other routes. You can be able to update, get... and get all users delete... For example, this delete user... You can only delete yourself. All the admin can delete all the... Any user, the admin can delete an user. But to delete your account, you can also access this route. So you can see on the database the users... You can see... It's reload. You see how they... You have added their users... I'm not testing. I've used the new user that you have just created. You can see he has already been added to the database. Let's get back. Let's test another route. Maybe you can test the card. The card also has several routes. You can first... You can first add a new card to... For creating a new card... A user can only have one card... So the card is connected to one user by their user ID. And you also have the same... The same happening with the orders. The orders are connected to the... The orders can only be updated to the... By the admin. But the user can be able to access the route and see where they... See the... For example, if we... We see the code for the... Models and... For the order. And see that the order schema... The... The user ID is used to connect every order. So every order must have one user. And only one... One user... The user can cancel their order. But... And they can also be able to track how far... How far they... The order is... They are spending... But it has just been sent. Or whether it has been delivered. So the admin can be able to change this... To update the routes and everything else. So the cards... The cards are for this... Every single person has only one... One card... Because they are connected by your user ID. You can't have two cards... The products... The products have several... Attributes... They have a title and a description. You can have an image... And category can be another... Because you can... Maybe it's a phone... You can have smart devices... And... This will belong to several categories at the same time. Here... And I also like MongoDB... Because you don't have to code... And use UTC in time now... It creates its own timestamps... For either update or... Or create that... You get your timestamps... With every deployment... For the... I think... I think that is all. So, currently I have not hosted this API... And... When I have found a friend... Frontend partner... Maybe I can host it... And then we can see what we can create in the end. Okay... Thank you. That's all.
